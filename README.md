Welcome to my dotfiles version (well really it doesn't exist a name for this version), anyway, *Linux based on KDE Plasma Kubuntu*. Honestly, I know the Ryo Yamada's version exist but I reinstalled again the OS (I broke it üò¢üò¢).

On this branch I modificated totally my OS.

I know Neofetch is dead, however, **fastfetch** is not my best option (yet).

Kitty is good terminal also I can put my images of my waifus xd.

<h1 align="center"> Change Wallpaper automatically üñº‚û°Ô∏èüñº </h1>

Ok. I made a script to change wallpaper. However, you must to run it again to change directory everytime. But I didn't want to do this, so I made a daemon to change wallpaper every minute.

1. Create the configuration file (not necessary root permissions)
```bash
nano  ~/.config/systemd/user/changewallpaper.service
```
On **changewallpaper.service** copy and change the parameters:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Change wallpaper of KDE desktop
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/bin/bash /home/youruser/pathScript/wallpaperKDE.sh /home/youruser/DirectoryOfYouWallpapers/
Restart=on-failure
StartLimitIntervalSec=60
StartLimitBurst=5

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
2. Create the timer configuration (not necessary root permissions)
```bash
nano  ~/.config/systemd/user/changewallpaper.timer
```
On **changewallpaper.timer** copy and change the parameters:
```bash
[Unit]
Description=Change wallpaper every minute

[Timer]
OnUnitActiveSec=1min
OnBootSec=1min

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```
3. Reload all user daemons.
```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```
4. Enable ```changewallpaper.service``` and ```changewallpaper.timer```
```bash
systemctl --user enable changewallpaper.service
```
```bash
systemctl --user enable changewallpaper.timer
```

Also I'll include the configurations on ```scriptsKDE/Changewallpaper```

So I made a script using bash and Python. I suggest you to use bash script.

> ONLY WORKS FOR KDE PLASMA.

# Talking about Neofetch

Neofetch configuration will be on ```scriptsKDE/Neofetch/config.conf```. Just **change the directory of you pictures**

I know Neofetch development was discontinued. But in my opinion, Neofetch is easier to use than Fastfetch (also I don't like to work with JSon files). So until Fastfetch will be easy to use I'll continue to use Neofetch.

Now my waifus collection is on ```Wallpaper/NeofetchIcons.zip```
About my wallpapers, it will be on same directory but the same is ```desktopwallpapers.zip```

# Welcome Sound
I made a script to give you a welcome you when you computer stars (like windows). So I modificated the script I've made before and change the names of sounds. It's funny.

1. Install MPV
```bash
sudo apt-get install mpv
```
2. Create a subdirectory on Documents, and name it ***startedSound***. And save there the script and the files audios.
3. Make sure that script has excecution permissions.
4. Modificate your startup to the path of the script ```startsound.sh```
