<h1 align="center"> Terminal emulator (Tilix) üñ•Ô∏è</h1>

Tilix is userful if you want to use many terminals at same time. However, for a neofetch picture appear on this terminal, will not do it. I recommend use *Kitty terminal*. Tilix is terminal I use.

    sudo apt install tilix

There is an issue that Tilix redirects to its official website to configure your *.bashrc* or *.zshrc*, but check the file on this path since it's changed.

<h1 align="center">Themes icons, windows and cursors ü™üüé®</h1>

GNOME needs an extra tool, for KDE plasma is not necessary.

    sudo apt-get install gnome-tweak-tool

For icons and cursos create a directory hidden with name *.icons*. Also, make it with name *.themes*. I use *candy icons*, *Sweet-cursos* and *Sweet-Dark*. However, you can find more [here](https://www.gnome-look.org/find?search=sweet).
